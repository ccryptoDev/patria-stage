      <h5>Definition Of Personal Information</h5>
      <p>
        "Personal Information" is information that, either alone or in
        combination with other information, can be used to identify you.
        Examples of Personal Information include, among others, name, email
        address, phone number, and mailing address. Personal Information
        includes certain information we collect when you apply for, or obtain, a
        financial product or service from us, which can include your Social
        Security number, account number, income, account balances, payment
        history, credit history, and credit scores. When we combine Personal
        Information with other information, we treat the combined information as
        Personal Information.

    <li>
      <h5>Information You Provide</h5>
      <p>
        We collect Personal Information you provide via forms, surveys,
        applications or other online fields including your name, mailing or
        email addresses, telephone, mobile numbers, or account numbers. The
        exact information we need to collect will depend on the purpose of the
        form. We will indicate on the form whether a particular field of
        information is mandatory or optional. If you choose not to provide
        certain information, we may not be able to provide requested services.

      <h5>Information Collected Automatically From You</h5>

            We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't
            have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us

            by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We

            the web page. The web server log also may record information about
            your device, such as your IP address, operating system, and internet

        How We Use Personal Information
      </h5>
      <p>
        Our primary purpose in collecting your Personal Information is to
        provide you with the products, services, and information that you
        request. We may use your Personal information to maintain, support, and
        answer any customer service-related questions. We may also aggregate
        your information with the information other users provide for business
        purposes such as to analyze data, conduct research, identify usage
        trends, develop and improve products or services, and enhance our Sites.
        We also may use this data for audit, loss prevention, and anti-fraud
        purposes and to comply with laws and regulations. We may use information
        for other purposes not listed here with your consent.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Security</h5>
      <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. We have
        implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to reduce
        the risk of accidental loss or unauthorized access, use, alteration, and
        disclosure of Personal Information in our possession or under our
        control. We take reasonable security measures to ensure sensitive data
        entered on the Sites is encrypted and transmitted in a secure way.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we use encryption to protect Personal Information transmitted
        online, we also protect your information offline. Our employees are
        periodically trained on the importance of information security and
        privacy issues to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and
        regulations. The servers on which we store Personal Information are kept
        in a safe and secure environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding these safeguards to store information in a secure
        environment that is not publicly available, we cannot guarantee the
        safety and integrity of your Personal Information during transmission
        and after we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
        method of electronic storage, is 100% secure from third parties such as
        hackers from illegally obtaining access to Personal Information.
        Therefore, we do not represent or warrant that your Personal Information
        will be protected against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.

        under the age 13 from the online collection of personal information. Our
        Sites are directed to a general audience and may be assessed by the
        public. Our Sites are not directed to individuals under the age of
