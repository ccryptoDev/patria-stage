          <h5>How much can I borrow?</h5>
          <p>
            New customers may borrow from $300 to $2,500 dollars. Qualified
            returning customers may be approved for more. We look at several
            factors to determine your loan amount. The factors we consider
            include your present income, other obligations, history with us
            and information gathered from third party data sources.

          <h5>Does it matter if I have bad credit or no credit?</h5>
          <p>
            Bad credit or no credit alone does not determine loan approval,
            it is just one of the things we consider during the loan
            approval process.

          <h5>What is Instant Bank Verification?</h5>
          <p>
            Instant Bank Verification (IBV) is a safe and secure process
            that allows us to temporarily view your bank statements. It will
            <b>not</b> allow us to access, withdraw, credit or transfer
            funds from your account.

To cancel your payment obligations on this loan, you must inform us in writing, by or before the Cancellation Deadline, by email to 
            <a href="mailto:CustomerCare@PatriaLending.com" class="link">CustomerCare@PatriaLending.com</a>
            that you want to cancel the future payment obligations on this loan. If we receive payment of the principal amount via the debit, then both your and our obligations under this Loan Agreement will be rescinded. If we do not receive payment of the principal amount by debit to Your Bank Account, then this Loan Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
