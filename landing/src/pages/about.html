      <h3>Otoe-Missouria History</h3>

        <div class="about-section-history-content-layout">
          <p>
            Otoe and Missouria oral histories begin in the region north of the
            Great Lakes. By around 1680, Europeans recorded the tribes in
            distinct areas of the mid-continent. In the 16th century, the Otoe,
            and Missouria broke away and moved to the south and west. The Otoe &
            Missouria people first came into contact with Europeans in the late
            17th century via Jacques Marquette, the famous French explorer, and
            missionary.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the late 17th century, the Missouria had settled near the
            Missouri and Grand rivers in what became Missouri. The Otoe settled
            along what is now the Iowa-Minnesota border. The state of Missouri
            and the Missouri River are both named after the Missouria Tribe,
            which controlled traffic and trade along the Missouri River and its
            tributaries. Trade was a vital part of Otoe and Missouria life for
            centuries. They traded with the Spanish, French and Americans for
            various goods. All three nations courted the Otoe and Missouria
            tribes for exclusive trading agreements.

              The Otoe and Missouria Tribes were living together when they
              encountered Lewis and Clarks’ Corps of Discovery Expedition of
              1803-1805 commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson.
            </p>
            <p>
              A sequence of land cessation treaties (1817, 1825, 1830, 1833,
              1836, 1854) had the effect of moving the tribes south and west. In
              the 1854 treaty, the tribes ceded their remaining land west of the
              Missouri River, and a reservation was created on the
              Kansas-Nebraska border. In 1876, the US Congress arranged the sale
              of 120,000 acres of the Otoe-Missouria reservation. It sold the
              remainder of the land in 1881, when Congress forced the
              Otoe-Missouria into Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these hardships, members of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe
              served patriotically and heroically in World War I, World War II,
              Korea, Vietnam, and other foreign campaigns. Women from Oklahoma’s
              tribal nations, including the Otoe-Missouria, served in the U.S.
              Coast Guard Women’s Reserves (“SPARS”) during World War II. They
              allowed male Coast Guardsmen who were working shore-side to
              fulfill sea duty. By releasing shore-side Coast Guardsmen for sea
              duty, these SPARS contributed to the Allied victory.

              The Otoe-Missouria Tribe today, located in Red Rock, OK is a
              federally recognized tribe and runs numerous Tribal enterprises to
              help fund services for its community including housing,
              healthcare, and education programs. According to a Taylor Policy
              Group study (provider of economic and public policy research to
              Native governments), the Tribe drives significant economic impact
              in Oklahoma and surrounding areas across the Tribe's various
              businesses including gaming, recreation, hospitality, land/cattle,
              financial services. The United States recognizes a
              government-to-government relationship with the Tribe and the Tribe
              exists politically in a "domestic dependent nation" status. As
              such, the Otoe-Missouria Tribe is a sovereign nation located
              within Oklahoma and the United States.
