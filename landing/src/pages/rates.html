            Interest rate is the percentage of the principal of a loan a lender
            charges a borrower to make the loan. Finance charges are a broader
            measure of the cost of borrowing that include both interest and any
            applicable fees. Annual percentage rate, or APR, expresses the
            finance charges on a loan as a yearly rate. Finance charges are
            based on a consumer’s creditworthiness. A consumer’s
            creditworthiness is determined by several factors, including credit
            and payment history, income, employment, existing debt, and types of
            debt. The APR for your loan will be determined by the amount you
            choose to borrow and the length of time you choose to keep your loan
            outstanding. You can reduce the total cost of your loan by paying
            off your loan prior to your last due date on your payment schedule
            or by making additional payments on or between your payment due
            dates.
