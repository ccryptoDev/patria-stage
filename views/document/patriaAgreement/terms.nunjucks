          any, described in the Disclosure Statement issued to me under the

          any unpaid accrued interest added to the Total Loan Amount; reasonable

        <p>
            <b>B.IMPORTANT – READ THIS CAREFULLY</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1.</b> By completing and signing the Application, and submitting it
          to you, either directly or through some other person, I am requesting
          that you make a Loan to me on the terms described in this Loan
          Agreement and in an amount equal to all or part of the Loan Amount
          Requested. When you receive my Application, you are not agreeing to
          lend me money. You have the right not to make a Loan or to lend an
          amount less than the Loan Amount Requested. If you decide to make a
          Loan to me, you will disburse the Loan funds either (a) directly to me
          electronically or by sending a check to me, or (b) directly to the
          holders of my unsecured consumer debts as specified by me in my
          Application (<b>“Prior Debts”</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. </b>I may cancel my application without any fee or penalty prior
          to funding of the Loan, as long as I provide you with sufficient
          advance notice to stop the Loan funding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. </b>
          Decreasing the Total Loan Amount– You can decrease the Total Loan
          Amount (i) based on updated payoff information you subsequently
          receive on the Prior Debts I have identified in my Application, (ii)
          if I ask you in writing to remove a Prior Debt from this Loan after I
          provide this signed Loan Agreement but prior to disbursement, or (iii)
          by refusing to disburse Loan proceeds to the holders of my Prior Debts
          if doing so is prohibited by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. </b>
          Updated Payoff Information– If after Loan proceeds are disbursed on my
          behalf, I receive updated payoff information showing that additional
          amounts remain owing on the Prior Debts I have identified for payoff,
          I will promptly pay the holders of my Prior Debts the additional
          amounts that remain owing on my Prior Debts and you will not be
          responsible in any way for paying off those amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5. HOW I AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LOAN.</b>
          If you agree to make a Loan to me, you will send me a Disclosure
          Statement under the Federal Truth in Lending Act. The Disclosure
          Statement will tell me the Total Loan Amount, the annual percentage
          rate on my Loan, and the amount of any fees. The Disclosure Statement
          is incorporated herein by this reference. My contractual obligation on
          this Loan Agreement will begin when Loan proceeds are disbursed to me
          or to the holders of my Prior Debs. To the extent any information in
          the Disclosure Statement conflicts with the information in this Loan
          Agreement, the information in the Disclosure Statement governs.

            <b>D. INTEREST</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Accrual</b> – Beginning on the Disbursement Date, interest will
          accrue at the Fixed Interest Rate indicated on the Disclosure
          Statement for the term of my Loan, on the principal balance of my Loan
          outstanding from time to time. Interest will be calculated on a daily
          simple interest basis according to the outstanding principal balance
          each day during the term of the Loan. The daily interest rate will be
          equal to the annual interest rate in effect on that day, divided by
          the actual number of days in that calendar year.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. Capitalization</b> – I agree that you may, at your option, and
          unless otherwise prohibited by Applicable Law, add all accrued and
          unpaid interest to the principal balance of my Loan (“
          <b>capitalized interest</b>”) at the end of any authorized period of
          forbearance. In all cases, thereafter, interest will accrue on the new
          principal balance. In addition, to the extent permitted by Applicable
          Law, if I am in default on my Loan, you may, at your option, add all
          accrued and unpaid interest to the principal balance of my Loan upon
          such default. Thereafter, interest will accrue on the new principal
          balance at the Fixed Interest Rate .
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Calculation</b> – The Fixed Interest Rate will be identified on
          the Disclosure Statement you send me. If my Loan has a Fixed Interest
          Rate it will not increase or decrease over the life of my Loan.. If at
          any time the Fixed Interest Rate as provided in this Section is not
          permitted by Applicable Law, interest will accrue at the highest rate
          allowed by Applicable Law.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>E. TERMS OF REPAYMENT</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Repayment Period</b> – The Repayment Period will begin on the
          Disbursement Date and will continue for the period specified in the
          Disclosure Statement. The amounts shown on my weekly statements will
          be consecutive weekly installments of principal and interest in
          approximately equal amounts over the number of months in the Repayment
          Period. During the Repayment Period, you will send me weekly
          statements electronically (showing Total Loan Amount and the amount of
          my weekly payment that is due). I will make weekly payments in the
          amounts and no later than the payment due dates shown on my electronic
          billing statements until I have paid all of the principal and interest
          and any other charges I may owe on my Loan.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. Amounts Owing at the End of the Repayment Period</b> – Since
          interest accrues daily upon the unpaid principal balance of my Loan,
          if I make payments after my payment due dates, I may owe additional
          interest. If I have not paid other fees and charges, I will also owe
          additional amounts for those fees and charges. In such cases you will
          increase the amount of my last weekly payment to the amount necessary
          to repay my Loan in full.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Application of Payments</b> – To the extent permitted by
          Applicable Law, payments will be applied first to fees and charges,
          then to accrued interest to the date payment is received, and then any
          remainder to the principal balance of my Loan.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Borrower Benefits</b> – I understand that this Loan does not
          entitle me to any borrower benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5. Late Fee</b> – If any payment that I owe on this Loan has not
          been received by us in the full amount due on a payment due date and
          remains past due for 7 days after that payment due date, then I agree
          that you may assess a late fee of $20. I authorize you and your agents
          to make a one-time withdrawal from my Bank Account to collect this fee
          if I have elected the EFT debit option.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>6. Returned Payment Fee</b> – If any payment that I made on this
          Loan is not honored or cannot be processed for any reason, including
          insufficient funds in my Bank Account, then I agree that you may
          assess a fee of $20.00. I authorize you and your agents to make a
          one-time withdrawal from my Bank Account to collect this fee if I have
          elected the EFT debit option. My financial institution may also impose
          a fee for a dishonored item.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>F. ORIGINATION FEE</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may charge me a Loan origination fee when Loan proceeds are
          disbursed. The total amount of the estimated Loan origination fee, if
          any, will be disclosed to me on my Disclosure Statement. The amount of
          the Loan origination fee, if any, will be deducted when my Loan
          proceeds are disbursed. If I prepay this Loan in full or in part at
          any time, I understand that I will not be entitled to a refund of any
          part of this Loan origination fee unless required by law.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>G. RIGHT TO PREPAY</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have the right to prepay all or any part of my Loan at any time
          without penalty. Any partial payment will be credited against my Loan
          Balance as described in Section E.3.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>H. FORBEARANCE</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may give me a forbearance in three (3) month increments if I am
          temporarily unable to make my scheduled Loan payments for
          unemployment. Requests for forbearance must be submitted in accordance
          with your reasonable procedures and requirements, and the decision to
          grant my request for forbearance shall be solely at your discretion.
          During any period of forbearance, regularly scheduled payments of
          principal and interest on my Loan may be deferred to the extent
          permitted by Applicable Law. Except as described above, I understand
          that I will remain responsible for all interest accruing during any
          period of forbearance and that to the extent permitted by Applicable
          Law you may add any interest that I do not pay during any forbearance
          period to the principal balance as described in Section D.2. I
          understand that any periods of forbearance will extend my Repayment
          Period as defined in Section E.1 unless prohibited by Applicable Law.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>I.COLLECTION COSTS</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless prohibited by Applicable Law, I agree to pay you all amounts,
          including reasonable attorneys’ fees, and collection agency, court and
          other collection costs that you incur in collecting or enforcing the
          terms of my Loan (collectively, <b>“Collection Costs”</b>) to the
          extent permitted by Applicable Law. The Collection Costs that I agree
          to pay may also include fees and costs incurred in connection with any

            To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, I will be in default and
            you have the right to give me notice that the whole outstanding
            principal balance, accrued interest, and all other amounts payable
            to you under this Agreement, are due and payable at once (subject to
            any Applicable Law which may give me a right to cure my default) if:
            (1) I fail to make any weekly payment to you within seven (7) days
            of its due date; or (2) I fail to notify you in writing of a change
            in my name, address, telephone number, or employment status; or (3)
            I become the subject of proceedings under the United States
            Bankruptcy Code or assign my assets for the benefit of my creditors;
            or (4) I break any of my other agreements in my Application or this
            Agreement; or (5) I make any false, misleading or materially
            incomplete statement in applying for this Loan, or to you at any
            time during the Repayment Period; or (6) I am declared legally
            incompetent or incapacitated. If I default, you may add all accrued
            and unpaid interest and other amounts to the principal balance of my
            Loan upon such default as described in Section D.2. If I default, I
            will be required to pay interest on this Loan accruing after default
            at the same rate of interest applicable to this Loan prior to my
            default. If I Default, you may require immediate payment in full of
            all sums due under this Agreement to the maximum extent allowable by
            Applicable Law. If I have authorized you to debit my Bank Account by
            EFT, you reserve the right to debit my account in an amount that
            represents payment in full of the amount that I owe at the time of
            default. You otherwise retain your right to pursue all legally
            available means to collect what I owe you.

            <b> 1. Definitions:</b>
          For purposes of dispute resolution and this Arbitration Agreement, the
          terms
          <b>“I”, “me”</b> and <b>“my”</b>
          include the borrower and his or her heirs, guardian, personal
          representative, or trustee in bankruptcy; the terms
          <b> “you”</b> and <b>“your”</b> mean Lender, Lender’s agents,
          servicers, assigns, vendors and any third party, Lender’s affiliated
          companies, and each of its and their respective agents,
          representatives, employees, officers, directors, members, managers,
          attorneys, successors, predecessors, and assigns. Any claim, dispute
          or controversy of any kind or nature between you and I about or
          involving my Loan, my Loan account, any prior loans or accounts I held
          with you (collectively <b> “loan account”</b>), my current Loan
          Agreement with you (including future amendments) or any prior loan
          agreement with you (all of which collectively are a
          <b> “Loan Agreement”</b>) or our relationship is referred to as a
          <b>“Dispute”</b>. Disputes include, for example, claims or disputes
          arising from or relating in any way to: the interpretation,
          applicability, validity, arbitrability, enforceability, formation or
          scope of any Loan Agreement or this Arbitration Agreement;
          transactions between you and I; any interest, charges, or fees
          assessed on my Loan; any service(s) or programs related to my Loan;
          any communications related to my Loan; and any collection or credit
          reporting of my Loan. Disputes also include claims or disputes arising
          from or relating in any way to advertising and solicitations, or the
          application for, approval, or establishment of my Loan. Disputes are
          subject to arbitration regardless of whether they are based on
          contract, tort, constitutional provision, statute, regulation, common
          law, equity or other source, and regardless of whether they seek
          legal, equitable and/or other remedies. All Disputes are subject to
          arbitration whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may
          arise in the future. Arbitration will apply even if my Loan is closed,
          sold or assigned; I pay you in full any outstanding debt I owe; or, to
          the maximum extent permitted by applicable bankruptcy law, I file for
          bankruptcy. If my Loan is sold and/or assigned, you retain your right
          to elect arbitration of Disputes by me and I retain my right to elect
          arbitration of Disputes by you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. Arbitration, generally:</b> When I submit a Dispute (defined
          below) to arbitration: my rights will be determined by a neutral
          arbitrator and not a judge or a jury. The procedures in arbitration
          are simpler and more limited than rules that are applied in court
          proceedings. Decisions by an arbitrator are subject to very limited
          review by a court.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree that the most current version of the Arbitration Agreement
          (except for any updates I have rejected properly within the time and
          manner provided) that is in effect as of the date you receive my
          notice of Dispute will govern the Dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Law Governing:</b>
          This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
          9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., and the law applicable in arbitration is
          Applicable Law, as that term is defined in my Loan Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Clarification Regarding Governing Law:</b>
          As separately provided, the law applicable in arbitration is
          Applicable Law, which includes applicable federal law. This means that
          in arbitration, I am entitled to invoke the same body of federal law
          that I would have been entitled to invoke in litigation. In other
          words, proceeding in arbitration gives me access to the exact same
          body of federal remedies available in litigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
            5. Application to Class Actions, Representative Actions and Waiver
            of Jury Trial:
          </b>
          Class actions, other similar representative procedures and
          consolidation of claims are NOT available under this Arbitration
          Agreement. I MAY NOT SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
          GENERAL OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, NOR MAY I PARTICIPATE
          AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, WITH
          RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM THAT IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. Further, I may
          not join my Dispute with other persons in the arbitration; each person
          must arbitrate his or her own Dispute(s) separately. I also waive my
          right to have a court or jury trial resolve my Dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>6. Informal Resolution:</b>
          You and I agree to attempt to first resolve any Dispute informally. I
          agree that I will notify you of my Dispute by sending an email to
          {{ tribe.legalEmail }}. My email must include my name, my Loan
          account number (or last 4 digits of my social security number), and
          address; describe the nature and basis of my Dispute; and use the
          phrase “Notice of Dispute” in the subject line. You will investigate
          my Dispute and let me know of your decision within 30 business days
          from the date you received my correspondence. If I do not accept your
          decision, then I may submit my Dispute to final and binding
          arbitration in the manner described in the section below (unless I
          have properly rejected the Arbitration Agreement in the time and
          manner provided above).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>7. Proceeding in Arbitration:</b>
          If the Dispute cannot be resolved informally, then you or I may file a
          claim for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (
          <b>“AAA”</b>) through its website at www.adr.org. If the AAA is unable
          or declines to administer the Dispute, then you and I agree to select
          a substitute arbitration organization to administer the Dispute. If
          you and I cannot agree on a substitute arbitration organization, then
          either of us may petition the United States District Court for the
          Northern District of Oklahoma or the courts of the state of Oklahoma
          sitting in Kay County to appoint the arbitration service provider, as
          permitted under 9 U.S.C. § § 5. (The AAA and any substitute
          arbitration service provider selected or appointed as contemplated
          here collectively are the <b>“Arbitration Organization”</b>.) You will
          reimburse my filing fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs
          of arbitration if I prevail. After the Arbitration Organization
          notices the parties that an arbitration demand has been filed, the
          responding party will have 14 days to file a response or counterclaim.
          After filing of the claim, response or counterclaim (if elected), no
          further claims or counterclaims may be made except on motion to the
          arbitrator. Any delay or failure to file a counterclaim or response
          will not delay an arbitration from proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. Selecting the Arbitrator:</b>
          The Arbitration Organization will provide you and I with a list of at
          least three arbitrator candidates from the National Roster, which, in
          order to be deemed acceptable as an arbitrator candidate, must (i) be
          either a retired judge or an attorney, (ii) have experience in
          contract matters, and (iii) to the extent practicable, have experience
          in Federal Indian law. You and I will select one arbitrator from that
          list of candidates. If you and I cannot agree on an arbitrator within
          10 days, then you or I may ask the Arbitration Organization to appoint
          an arbitrator from the list of candidates. If the designated
          arbitrator becomes unable or unwilling to proceed, then you and I
          agree that a substitute arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the
          AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>9. Preliminary Management Hearing; Discovery; Motions:</b>
          The Arbitration Organization will schedule a preliminary management
          hearing with the appointed arbitrator to narrow the issues and
          establish a schedule and procedure for any law and motion proceedings
          to expedite arbitration. The preliminary management hearing will be
          conducted by conference call, video conference or internet. Discovery
          will be completed within 60 days of this preliminary management
          hearing and will consist exclusively of: (a) one set of
          interrogatories to each party not to exceed 15 in number including
          subparts, and (b) Loan account information and documents pertaining to
          credit that I sought or obtained from you. Subject to Principle 13 of
          the AAA’s consumer Due Process Protocol, any other forms of discovery
          will be allowed only upon a showing of good cause to the arbitrator.
          The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and
          will take appropriate steps to protect confidential or proprietary
          information. The arbitrator may decide any motion that is
          substantially similar to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
          claim or a motion for summary judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>10. Administration and Procedures; Award; Fees:</b>
          The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, available at www.adr.org/Rules,
          will be used to administer the arbitration, and you and I each agree
          that the Dispute will be arbitrated solely through submission of
          documents in accordance with the AAA Procedures for the Resolution of
          Disputes Through Document Submission, without an in-person or
          telephonic hearing. If the arbitrator decides that an in person
          hearing is necessary, however, then the arbitration will be conducted
          on Tribal land or within thirty (30) miles of my then-current
          residence, at my choice, provided that this accommodation for me shall
          not be construed in any way (a) to relinquish or waive the sovereign
          status or immunity of the Tribe, (b) to relinquish or waive the
          sovereign status of Lender or expand the scope of the limited waiver
          provided by Lender below in the paragraph entitled “Enforcement of
          Award”, or (c) to constitute a transaction of business in any place
          other than the Indian country of the Tribe. The arbitrator is bound by
          the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. He or she must apply
          Applicable Law, the terms of the Loan Agreement and this Arbitration
          Agreement. If the AAA’s rules or procedures are different than the
          terms of this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration
          Agreement will control. You and I agree that the arbitrator will issue
          a concise written award, in accordance with the timing requirements
          under the AAA Rules. The decision and award shall have no precedential
          or collateral estoppel effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment
          and reimbursement of fees and expenses, at any time during the
          proceeding and upon request from you or I within 14 days of the
          arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. The right to attorneys’ fees and
          expenses discussed in this paragraph supplements any right to
          attorneys’ fees and expenses I may have under Applicable Law, but I
          may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or costs. If you
          prevail in arbitration and have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees
          and expenses, you will not seek such an award.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>11. Appeal:</b> You or I can file a written appeal to the
          Arbitration Organization within 30 days after an award is issued by
          filing a notice of appeal with any AAA office, which appeal will be
          administered by the Arbitration Organization pursuant to AAA’s
          Consumer Appellate Arbitration Policy, available here and at{" "}

            <b>12. Enforcement of Award:</b>
          Any final arbitration award will be binding on the named parties and
          judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in, and be
          enforceable by, the United States District Court for the Northern
          District of Oklahoma or if such federal court fails to find
          jurisdiction, then in the courts of the state of Oklahoma sitting in
          Kay County, and appellate courts therefrom. Lender grants a limited
          waiver of its sovereign immunity which is limited to (i) arbitration
          of a Dispute only in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
          Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) enforcing a final award issued in such
          arbitration in the United States District Court for the Northern
          District of Oklahoma or if such federal court fails to find
          jurisdiction, then in the courts of the state of Oklahoma sitting in
          Kay County, and appellate courts therefrom. This limited waiver is
          made by Lender to me only, does not include any waiver (express or
          implied) to any other person, and does not waive the sovereign
          immunity of the Tribe or any of the Tribe’s other entities. The
          limited waiver also does not exist to class-wide or representative
          claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>13. Severability:</b>
          The provisions of this Arbitration Agreement will, where possible, be
          interpreted to sustain its legality and enforceability. If any
          provision of the Loan Agreement or this Arbitration Agreement or the
          whole of it is determined to be unenforceable, then the arbitrator may
          sever and/or reform any such provision to make it enforceable. The
          arbitrator may not, however, reform the clause requiring for Disputes
          to be heard on an individual basis or the waiver of the right to
          participate in any class or collective action against you.

        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that you may sell, transfer or assign my Agreement
          without my consent. Should ownership of my Loan be transferred, I will
          be notified of the name, address, and telephone number of the new
          lender if the address to which I must make payments changes. Sale or
          transfer of my Loan does not affect my rights and responsibilities
          under this Agreement. I understand that acting in the capacity of a
          non-fiduciary agent to me, you will maintain a register to record the
          entitlement to payments of principal and interest on my Agreement and
          that beneficial ownership of such payments under my Agreement as
          reflected in the register will be conclusive notwithstanding notice to
          the contrary. You will notify me of a change in ownership reflected in
          the register if (1) this alters the address to which I must make
          payments or (2) upon my reasonable written request. Sale, assignment
          or transfer of my Agreement or beneficial interest in payments of
          principal and interest on my Agreement does not affect my rights and
          responsibilities under this Agreement.

          To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money
