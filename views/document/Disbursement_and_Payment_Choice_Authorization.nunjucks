</p>

<p>
<strong>Payments You will Make Directly.</strong>  Please note, you are not required to authorize this payment choice authorization option in order to be funded your loan.

<br>
</p>

<p>
<strong>REMOTELY CREATED CHECKS:</strong>  if we do not receive your check or money order or payment via ACH or by debit card authorization by the Due Dates, You agree to make all payments required under the Loan Agreement by having us create paper checks drawn on your Bank Account and bearing your typed name rather than your handwritten signature ( "Remotely Created Checks" ). You authorize us and our agents, successors and assigns   to submit each Remotely Created Check for payment to the Paying Bank in the amount of each payment owing under this Loan Agreement, including any returned payment charges or other amounts owing to us upon acceleration of this Loan as a result of your Default. Your typed name shall constitute your authorized signature fully reflecting your intent to authenticate these Remotely Created Checks, which are also known as demand drafts, tele-checks, preauthorized drafts, or paper drafts. If you believe we charged your Bank Account in a manner not contemplated by this authorization, then please contact us on at our toll free phone number (866) 677-1500 or sending us an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@patria.com">support@patria.com</a>. You authorize us to vary the amount of any pre-authorized payment by Remotely Created Check as needed to repay installments due on the loan as modified by any prepayments.
<br>
</p>

<p>
<strong>RETURNED ITEM FEE:</strong>  If any payment made by you on this Loan is not honored or cannot be processed for any reason, including not enough money in your Bank Account, you agree to pay us a fee of ${{financeCharge}}. You authorize   us and our agents to make a one-time withdrawal from your Bank Account to collect this fee, if you have also selected the ACH Debit Authorization. Your financial institution may also impose a fee.
<br>
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTICE OF VARYING AMOUNTS:</strong>  For those customers who have chosen the ACH Debit Authorization, please note that you have the right to receive notice of all withdrawals from your Bank Account by an ACH Debit that vary in amount. However, by agreeing to let us withdraw the money from your Bank Account, you agree we only have to tell you the range of withdrawals that we can make. The range of withdrawals will be either an amount equal to your installment payment or an amount equal to the outstanding balance under the Loan (which may   be greater than or less than an installment payment based upon your payment history). For any withdrawal outside of this specified range, we will send you a notice 10 days prior to the date of the debit. Therefore, by signing this Agreement below, you acknowledge that you will only receive notice when a withdrawal exceeds    the amount in the specified range. You authorize us to vary the amount of any withdrawal as needed to repay installments due on the Loan as modified by any partial prepayments you make.
