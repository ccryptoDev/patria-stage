Dear Applicant, Thank you for your recent application for a loan with Patria Lending. Our Team has reviewed your application and has determined that due your income being insufficient for the amount of credit requested, a revised loan amount has been offered. Please log in to your account to view your new loan amount and complete the application process.  Should you have any questions, please contact our office at customercare@Patrialending.com.
