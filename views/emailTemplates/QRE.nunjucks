Dear Applicant, We recently received your application for a loan with Patria Lending. Unfortunately, the first and last name do not match the first and last name referenced on your bank account. Please log in to your application and upload a recent bank statement showing your name on the account. Should you have any questions, please contact our office at customercare@Patrialending.com.                                   Thank you, Customer Care
